    logger.info("No speech detected, retrying with lower threshold")
    segments, _ = self.model.transcribe(
        audio,
        beam_size=self.beam_size_partial,
        temperature=0.2,  # Add slight randomness

  - Enabled proper L1-specific contrast note retrieval for Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian speakers
- [x] **CSS cascade bug fixes**: Resolved legitimate CSS specificity warnings that were preventing proper style application
  - **Root cause**: Base `.contrast-note` styles (lines 175-183) came AFTER L1-specific overrides, breaking cascade
  - **Solution**: Moved base styles to line 103 BEFORE L1-specific styles to ensure proper inheritance
  - **Result**: L1-specific colors and fonts now properly apply while maintaining base styling
  - **Biome linting compliance**: Fixed 2 `noDescendingSpecificity` warnings by correcting actual cascade bugs

### L1 Language Service Features

- [x] **Complete language support**: Polish (PL), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (SR), Serbian (SR) with native/English names
- [x] **localStorage persistence**: User L1 preference stored with key `'bgvc_l1_preference'`
- [x] **Dynamic typography**: Body classes (`l1-pl`, `l1-ru`, etc.) for language-specific font rendering
- [x] **Interactive language selector**: Dropdown with native names "Polski (Polish)", "Русский (Russian)", etc.

- [x] **Cross-component integration**: Custom events (`l1-language-changed`) for system-wide updates

### CSS Typography System

- [x] **Font family hierarchy**: L1-specific fonts with Bulgarian text remaining in Ysabeau for all users
  - Polish: "Lato", "Roboto" for UI elements
  - Russian: "PT Sans", "Roboto" for UI elements
  - Ukrainian: "e-Ukraine", "Arsenal" for UI elements
  - Serbian: "Noto Sans Serbian", "Ubuntu" for UI elements
- [x] **Color-coded contrast notes**: Unique color scheme per L1 language for contrastive explanations
  - Polish: Blue (#1976d2)
  - Russian: Red (#d32f2f)
  - Ukrainian: Orange (#ffa000)
  - Serbian: Purple (#7b1fa2)
- [x] **CSS custom properties**: `--contrast-bg` variables for consistent theming across all L1 languages

### Backend Integration

- [x] **Configuration API endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/config` - Returns current L1 language and supported languages list
  - `POST /api/config/l1` - Updates L1 language preference (session-based)
- [x] **Content system integration**: L1-specific contrast notes in grammar items and drill responses
- [x] **Fallback mechanisms**: Default L1 language from environment configuration when user preference unavailable
- [x] **Input validation**: Server-side validation ensuring only supported L1 codes (PL, RU, UK, SR) accepted

### Code Quality Improvements

- [x] **Biome linting compliance**: Achieved 100% linting success by fixing actual CSS cascade issues rather than bypassing rules
- [x] **Maintained beneficial linting**: Kept `noDescendingSpecificity` rule enabled as it catches legitimate bugs
- [x] **Proper error handling**: All L1 language operations include graceful fallback and error recovery
- [x] **TypeScript compatibility**: All JavaScript files formatted with proper 2-space indentation for CI consistency

### Integration with Existing Systems

### Testing Coverage

- [x] **Server endpoint tests**: All L1-related API endpoints validated in existing test suite
- [x] **CSS regression testing**: Verified cascade order fixes don't break existing functionality
- [x] **Configuration validation**: Environment configuration properly handles L1 language settings
- [x] **Error handling tests**: Graceful failure when invalid L1 codes provided

### Critical Development Note: Linting Discipline

⚠️ **Important**: During this implementation, we discovered the importance of **NOT bypassing linting checks** with `--no-verify` or similar flags. The CSS specificity warnings were actually **legitimate cascade bugs** that prevented L1-specific styling from working properly.

**Key lesson**: Always fix linting issues rather than bypassing them - linting rules often catch real bugs that impact functionality.

**Best practice**: Run `just lint` before every commit and resolve all issues. Pre-commit hooks should never be bypassed as they prevent functional bugs from reaching production.
