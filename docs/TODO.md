# üìã TODO - Bulgarian Voice Coach

Items remaining to be implemented from the original build plan and additional improvements needed.

## üéØ Current Status

The Bulgarian Voice Coach is a **fully functional voice-enabled language learning application** with:

### ‚úÖ Core Features Working

- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Whisper-based ASR with VAD for Bulgarian speech
- **Grammar Error Detection**: 40+ Bulgarian grammar rules with contextual corrections
- **Interactive Learning**: Micro-drills, mini-lessons, and spaced repetition (SRS)
- **Text-to-Speech**: eSpeak NG for Bulgarian pronunciation feedback
- **Multi-L1 Support**: Tailored feedback for Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian speakers

### ‚úÖ Technical Excellence

- **Local-First Architecture**: All progress stored in localStorage, no auth needed
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time audio streaming and processing
- **Docker Ready**: Production & dev containers with Bun and Wolfi-based images
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 79+ frontend tests, full backend coverage
- **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI specification
- **Health Monitoring**: Health checks, logging, error handling

### üöÄ Ready For

- Local development (`just dev`)
- Docker deployment (`docker-compose up`)
- Single-user learning sessions
- Bulgarian language practice with immediate feedback

### ‚è≥ Not Yet Available

- Cloud deployment (needs deployment guide)
- Multi-user support (by design - local-first)
- Advanced TTS voices (still using eSpeak)
- Usage analytics (privacy-first approach)
- Progressive audio streaming (uses full audio chunks)
